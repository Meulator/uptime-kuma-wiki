## Fix the Connect ENOENT error when trying to monitor local Docker


In case you installed Uptime Kuma on docker, you might want to monitor other container running on the same machine.

If you create a docker container in uptime kuma, by default it points probably to the right location (/var/run/docker.sock) but it will give you an error : Connect ENOENT /var/run/docker.sock

In order to fix it, you have to add :

      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      
 to your docker-compose file, under Volume.
 
 Don't forget the " :ro " (read only) ; if you forget it, your docker container will be at risk!
